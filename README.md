## Project 1: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster # Under Construction
* Goal is to predict from the passenger's data, who will live and who will die
* Although beeing a well known project int he DS world, it is helping me to validate design and feature engineering concepts in the DS processes
* Testing differente Machine Learning algorithms, evaluating their performance and tuning parameters to increase model's classification

## [Project 2: Sales Prediction](https://github.com/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Sales%20Prediction.ipynb)
* Model that used Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict sales feedback based on TV, Radio and Newspaper advertisement investment
* Using 70% of the dataset for training, the Random Forest obtained better results than Linear Regression based on R-squared evaluation
* The higher the investment on TV, the higher the sales, compared to Radio and Newspaper investment

## [Project 3: Web Scraping and automation using Python](https://github.com/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Web%20Scrapping%20and%20Automation%20using%20Python.ipynb)
* Created a script based on selenium to search the web for specific information
* The tool searches for different currency exchange rates such as Dolar, Euro and Gold compared to brazilian real
* The information is then stored and an excel file is automatically created for further analysis

## [Project 4: Churn Data Analysis](https://github.com/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Churn%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
* Analysed the churn potencial from a Telecom company
* The results were very satisfatory and similar to business reality
  * Most of costumer churn derivates from pre-paid phones and other interesting validations
* Used mainly Pandas and plotly libraries

## [Project 5: Recommendation System of Spotify Musics](https://github.com/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Recommendation%20System.ipynb)
* Built three reccommendations systems by ratings that returns related songs based on user ratings
* Objective was to use a collaborative filter based on item using differente approaches (Euclidian Distantes and Cosine Similarity)
* Expressing the different methods of treating null values
* Use of normalization techniques and pivoting

## [Project 6: World evolution of Covid-19 cases: Project Overview](https://datastudio.google.com/s/ouiVw0gYe_o)
* Created a data visualization tool representing the covid-19 cases evolution around the world
* Selection is based by country, continent or the entire world
* The graph representation demonstrates the absolute and relative growth of covid-19 cases
* Used Excel basic functions and Google Data Studio
