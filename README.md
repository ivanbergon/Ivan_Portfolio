### [Project 0: Medicine Price Prediction](https://github.com/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Medicine%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb)
* Predict price of medicines based on its formulation
* Used 7 different Machine Learning algorithms
* Satisfatory results, but need improovement in preprocessing and algorithm otimization
* Best Results: MAE: 59,43 R2 score: 0,092 using XGBoost, Target value Mean: 137.09

### [Project 1: Brazilian E-commerce analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Brazilian%20E-commerce.ipynb)
*	Clustering, prediction and feature engineering
*	Project is on construction, will be complete soon.

### [Project 2: Sales Prediction](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Sales%20Prediction.ipynb)
* Predictive sales model based on TV, radio and newspaper advertising investment
* From the models used, the random forest had the best performance (96%) at R-squared metric
* As expected, the TV investment had the highest sales return, followed by radio and newspaper

### [Project 3: Web Scraping and automation using Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Web%20Scrapping%20and%20Automation%20using%20Python.ipynb)
*	Created a script based on selenium to search the web for specific information
*	The tool searches for different currency exchange rates such as Dollar, Euro and Gold compared to Brazilian real
*	The information is then stored and an excel file is automatically created for further analysis

### [Project 4: Churn Data Analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Churn%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
* The scope of this project aimed at a telecommunication company’s clients churn potential
* The analyzes pointed that new customer, with prepaid plans and using fiber internet, have more potential to churn
* A possible solution would be to offer the clients a special incentive annual plan or long-term contract

### [Project 5: Recommendation System of Spotify Musics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Recommendation%20System.ipynb)
*	Construction of three recommendation systems with different methods of data treatment and similarity measures
*	Objective was to use a collaborative filter based on item using different approaches (Euclidian Distances and Cosine Similarity)
* Filling in with missing data using zero or the maximum score does not change the final result; and the use of the Cosine similarity method generates different and more interpretive results than the Euclidean distance

### [Project 6: World evolution of Covid-19 cases: Project Overview](https://datastudio.google.com/s/ouiVw0gYe_o)
*	Created a data visualization tool representing the covid-19 cases evolution around the world
*	Selection is based by country, continent or the entire world
*	The graph representation demonstrates the absolute and relative growth of covid-19 cases
*	Used Excel basic functions and Google Data Studio
