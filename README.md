## Regression

### [Oil Price Prediction in R](https://github.com/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Oil%20Price%20Prediction.pdf)
* Predict one day ahead oil prices based on other stock indexes.
* Used GAMLSS package and its Oil Data Set.
* Successfully predicted 93.3% of the price values within a 1% deviation interval from the true values
* Successfully predicted 79% of the price values within a 0.5% deviation interval from the true values.

### [Medicine Price Prediction in Python](https://github.com/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Medicine%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb)
* Predict price of medicines based on its formulation using 7 different Machine Learning algorithms
* Satisfatory results, but used wrong strategy on preprocessing. Better results would be achieved using One Hot Encoding

### [Sales Prediction in Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Sales%20Prediction.ipynb)
* Predictive sales model based on TV, radio and newspaper advertising investment
* From the models used, the random forest had the best performance (96%) at R-squared metric
* As expected, the TV investment had the highest sales return, followed by radio and newspaper

## Classification

### [Rio de Janeiro's Airbnb data - Room Type Multiclass Classification in Python](https://github.com/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/AirBnB%20Room%20Type%20Prediction.ipynb)
* Make use of multiclass classification Random Forest model to predict the class of  4 room types of 23635 observations and 74 variables
* Chose only 4 variables to assertively predict the class of 98,4% of the data.
* Very good model performance, but could be improved with some tuning.

## Data Analysis

### [Churn Data Analysis in Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Churn%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
* The scope of this project aimed at a telecommunication companyâ€™s clients churn potential
* The analyzes pointed that new customer, with prepaid plans and using fiber internet, have more potential to churn
* A possible solution would be to offer the clients a special incentive annual plan or long-term contract

### [Brazilian E-commerce analysis in Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Brazilian%20E-commerce.ipynb)
*	Clustering, prediction and feature engineering
*	Project is on construction, will be complete soon.

## Data Pipeline

### [Data Preparation Pipeline in R](https://github.com/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Oil%20Pipeline.pdf)
* Design and implement an entire data preparation pipeline in R
* Based on GAMLSS Package and its Oil Data Set.
* Pipeline to add new Drivers and to make user-specified transformations on data.

## Recommendation System

### [Recommendation System of Spotify Musics in Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Recommendation%20System.ipynb)
*	Construction of three recommendation systems with different methods of data treatment and similarity measures
*	Objective was to use a collaborative filter based on item using different approaches (Euclidian Distances and Cosine Similarity)
* Filling in with missing data using zero or the maximum score does not change the final result; and the use of the Cosine similarity method generates different and more interpretive results than the Euclidean distance

## Web Scraping

### [Web Scraping and automation using Python in Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ivanbergon/Ivan_Portfolio/blob/main/Web%20Scrapping%20and%20Automation%20using%20Python.ipynb)
*	Created a script based on selenium to search the web for specific information
*	The tool searches for different currency exchange rates such as Dollar, Euro and Gold compared to Brazilian real
*	The information is then stored and an excel file is automatically created for further analysis

## Data Visualization

### [World evolution of Covid-19 cases: Project Overview](https://datastudio.google.com/s/ouiVw0gYe_o)
*	Created a data visualization tool representing the covid-19 cases evolution around the world
*	Selection is based by country, continent or the entire world
*	The graph representation demonstrates the absolute and relative growth of covid-19 cases
*	Used Excel basic functions and Google Data Studio
